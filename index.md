## Ethical Considerations in Using Artificial Intelligence (A10), Dr. Rasmus Nielsen

1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

   The most intriguing topic in my domain this quarter is the exploration of algorithmic fairness in the context of tax audit selection by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The study delves into the concept of vertical equity, which is essential for fairness in public policy settings. Specifically, the research investigates how the adoption of modern machine learning methods in taxpayer audit selection may impact vertical equity, shedding light on the allocation of tax and enforcement burdens across taxpayers of different income levels. The findings highlight the shifting audit burdens from high to middle-income taxpayers when employing more flexible machine learning methods. Additionally, the research examines the application of algorithmic fairness techniques to address disparities across income buckets, emphasizing the trade-off between mitigating disparities and maintaining performance. The study's insights into the consequences of treating the risk of underreporting as a classification or regression problem, as well as the role of audit cost in shaping audit distribution, have significant implications for ongoing policy debates and the design of algorithmic tools in the public sector. The paper underscores the potential impact of a narrow focus on return-on-investment in undermining vertical equity and provides valuable insights for shaping fair tax administration policies.

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
   - **Gender Bias in Hiring Algorithms:**
     Explore the presence of gender bias in hiring algorithms by analyzing datasets related to job applications and hiring decisions. Investigate how machine learning models impact the selection process and whether there are disparities in the outcomes based on gender.

   - **Credit Scoring and Fair Lending:**
     Investigate algorithmic fairness in credit scoring systems used by financial institutions. Analyze datasets related to credit applications and approvals to assess whether machine learning models exhibit biases in determining creditworthiness, potentially affecting different demographic groups.

3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

   A potential change I'd make to the approach taken in my current Q1 project would be to have fewer team members and start early. Having fewer team members will be more beneficial given that it is much easier to split up tasks and communicate. I also would like to start early on my project given the lessons learned from Q1.

5. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
   
   I would be interested in potentially using ensemble methods. I could employ ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models. Ensuring diversity in the ensemble can help mitigate biases present in individual models. This approach can improve overall fairness and generalization performance.
