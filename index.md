title: "Mitigating Director Gender Bias in Movie Recommender Systems"
---

## Introduction

Studies in sociology and media studies have revealed a **gender gap** in the film industry, with an **underrepresentation** of **female directors** in film production.
  - In over 2000 films released between 1994 and 2016, only **5%** of the directors were **female**.[[^1]]
  - In top-grossing films released between 2007 and 2021, the ratio of **male to female** directors was **11:1**.[[^2]]

However, the implications of this disparity on recommendation systems is not widely researched.
  - Most studies look at bias from a statistical perspective (e.g., popularity bias).

Many content distribution platforms (such as Netflix) utilize recommendation models for personalized user content.
  - A recommender system filters information (e.g., user and item data) to provide personalized suggestions to users.
  - We investigate whether this gender bias is embedded into the outputs and suggestions of various recommendation models, developed using different similarity metrics and algorithms.

Widely adopted bias mitigation tools (e.g., [IBM's AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)) are also optimized for **regression** and **classification** tasks, not recommendation tasks.
  - Our project fills this gap by investigating whether bias mitigation techniques developed for regression and classification tasks can be **extended to recommendation systems**.

Our aim is to develop a fair movie recommender system that minimizes biases associated with the gender of the director.

## Methods

The [data](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) for **user ratings** is sourced from [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/), an online platform that provides personalized movie recommendations based on users' viewing preferences and rating history.
  - We gather over a million anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined the platform in 2000.
